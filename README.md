# StackImplementation

Created August 2019

This is my implementation of the Stack data structure.

I have utilized an interface for my class implementation, and I have also included a program that runs in the console and allows the user to manipulate a Stack using all the associated functions.

Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors 
  (class implements interface)
